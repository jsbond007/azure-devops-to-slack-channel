# azure-devops-to-slack-channel
Send customized message to slack when a change is made in Azure Devops Tasks - Specifically handled a custom Field - Original Estimate vs Actual Estimate. If a developer goes and changes the estimate then notify in slack channel. 
Default integration of Devops doesn't give clarify of what has been changed actually. We can also do the same thing with Microsoft Teams.
